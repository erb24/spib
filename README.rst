What is it?
-----------

SPIB is a deep learning-based framework for dimension reduction and Markov model construction of MD trajectories. Please read and cite this manuscript when using SPIB: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0038198. Here is an implementation of SPIB in Pytorch.

I (Eric) have modified this branch to incorporate the physics-based penalty term in the loss function.
